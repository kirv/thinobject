NAME
    Boolean -- implement boolean attribute using symlink 

DESCRIPTION
    

METHODS
    set     -- set the attribute to the true value
    clear   -- set the attribute to the false value
    is      -- assert attribute is true or of the given value
    show    -- print attribute value to stdout
    help    -- display this help screen

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    boolean_states -- colon-separated strings for states, default is true:false
    boolean_remove -- if set, delete attribute for false state; not the default

IMPLEMENTATION
    An Attribute object is a symlink file with it's target set to a string
    value with prefix =.  The prefix is intended to make collisions with
    actual files unlikely, 

    The Boolean object value is set either to =true or =false, 
    or the two strings specified in the boolean_states variable (separated
    by :, a colon).

    If variable boolean_remove is set, the attribute file is removed to 
    represent the false state.
