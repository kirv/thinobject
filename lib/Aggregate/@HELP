NAME
    Aggregate -- thinobject class for aggregating objects 

DESCRIPTION
    An Aggregate object is a container of other objects, and will
    pass methods along to those objects, in order or per some other
    crieria.

    Method calls on the contained object is done using the thinobject
    enabler/dispatcher, so contained objects can be of different classes.

METHODS
    do    -- apply given method and argument to contained objects
    order -- define order for operating on contained objects
    help  -- display this help screen
    _default  -- links to method do

SEE ALSO
    Aggregate.do --help, Aggregate.order --help

BUGS

    The @order property is required, but this should default to everthing
    in the container.

    If all contained objects are the same class, or at least share the
    same same, exact method, the the dispatcher could be skipped and the
    method invoked directly.

    Falling through to superclass methods is probably broken by this 
    aggregate mechanism...
