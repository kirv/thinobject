NAME

ThinObject - Perl extension for the ThinObject system of persistent objects.

SYNOPSIS

  use ThinObject;
  my $tob = ThinObject->new("path/object");
  print $tob->ls;

DESCRIPTION

ThinObject is a scheme, a set of conventions, to realize object oriented 
behaviors on the linux filesystem.  An object is an ordinary file or 
directory with a so-named hidden dot-file (or directory) storing key 
object data.

This ThinObject module provides a base object for perl programs, including
some simple methods.

METHODS

  * new(PATHNAME)
    create a new object instance in memory, given the pathname of an existing 
    object
    
  * print_debug()
    print debug string showing base object properties
    
  * exists()
    return true if object exists, or false
    
  * ob_type()
    return object type, FILE or DIRECTORY
    
  * tob_type()
    return dot-object type, FILE or DIRECTORY
    
  * name()
    return object name
    
  * path()
    return object path
    
  * list(PROPERTY)
    return list of entries from property (file) 
    
    TODO: support list( PROPERTY, n), where n identifies the nth entry (1 being
    the first entry), but also a range or list using n..m or n,m,p,q,...
    
  * hash(PROPERTY)
    return hash reference of key=value entries from property (file) 
    
    TODO: support hash(PROPERTY, key ) and hash(PROPERTY, key=value)
    
  * method_option()
  * method_option(KEY)
  * method_option(KEY, VALUE)
    Reads hash values from class and option properties with the method name
    following the "%" character.  The first form returns all keys in the
    hash; the second returns the value of the given key; the last sets the
    key value and returns it.
    
  * auto-generated methods
    If a property/file name begins with "%" or "@", the hash() or list() method
    is called by using the name (with the leading "type" character) directly.
    
  * ls(OPTIONS)
    wrap shell C<ls> with options
    
  * find(OPTIONS)
    wrap shell C<find> with options.  Option -exec is not allowed.

TODO

  * has(), or hasa()
    return list of contained objects, as TYPE NAME

  * has(TYPE), or hasa(TYPE)
    return list of contained objects of specified TYPE
