I just created the file NOTES in the source tree for the class-source
thinobject application, then did tob class-source.notes and here we 
are!

Tweaked the install method to synch data to multiple targets via the
--host option.

Something that is needed is to make sure target directories are synched
with the source in the sense that there's no other content in the targets.
I tried just using rsync's -delete or whatever option and succeeded in wiping
out the entire repository.
