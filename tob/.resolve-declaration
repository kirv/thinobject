    This is an interesting case, since resolve_declaration takes two
    arguments, even creating a local version of the first one, but 
    only uses the second one.  So it's a case at least of cruft lying
    around in the code, if not an actual bug.

    Also worth noting is that this function checks for the existence
    of a type declaration, but does not check that the type actually 
    resolves under TOBLIB.
