NAME
    tob -- parse and resolve object.method, invoke method in object directory

SYNOPSIS
    tob [OPTIONS] object.method [METHOD_OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
    tob -m method [-a arg]... object...

DESCRIPTION
    Thinobject strives to achieve object oriented programming and data
    management directly on the filesystem, in a language-independent way.
    Methods are executable programs, written in any language.  Thinobject
    uses a symlink, .^ or ^, to a class directory (or handler).  Methods
    and attributes are searched for along the chain of class links.

EXIT VALUE
    Exit value should be 0 if no error occurred, but should have a value
    from 101 to 123 if there was an error.  The numbers are assigned
    sequentially in the tob script, and for now that's the only documentation
    for what specific values mean.

OPTIONS
    -s X
    export "X", e.g., where X is envar=value, 

    -d
    turn on debug output

    -v
    turn on verbose output

    -m M
    --method M
    apply method M to the following list of objects    

    -a ARGS...
    --arg ARGS...
    provide arguments; useful in conjunction with the --method option

    -h
    --help
    show this help screen (manpage)

    -q
    --quiet
    suppress output to stderr on errors
    
OBJECT CREATION
    Use tob-new to create objects.

BUILT-IN METHODS
    path
        output the object directory path

    type
        output the class hierarchy

PROPERTIES
    The thinobject system uses ordinary files and directories in the
    filesystem, so the content of an object is arbitrary.  It may be
    convenient/helpful to think of the contents of an object as its
    ``properties'', if only to distinguish them from otherwise ordinary
    files (which they really are).

    Special meaning is applied to certain files, as follows:

    ^
    .^
    symlink to the parent class

    ^foo
    .^foo
    symlink to a mixin class


SEARCH PATHS
    tob prepares a search path for methods and one for attributes.
    These differ mainly in that methods are not resolved in the object,
    while attributes may be.

    Mixin classes are searched before the parent class, in lexical 
    order.  Common ancestor classes are searched last. 

EXPORTED VARIABLES
    TOB_object -- the object name as passed to the thinob enabler

    TOB_method -- the invoked method

    TOB_type -- the nominal class name

    TOB_class_path -- the class directory or handler path

    TOB_object_path -- the fully resolved object name

    TOB_search_paths -- search paths for object attributes

    TOB_method_paths -- search paths for object methods

    TOB_caller_path

    TOB_caller_path_to_object

    TOB_path_to_object

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    TOB_resolve_method
    TOB_get_attr

   output format is: $TOB_object.$TOB_method: ARGUMENTS...

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    A few variables are checked for:
        QUIET -- suppress output from warn() if set
        DEBUG -- output various debugging statements
        VERBOSE -- output array variable $errmsg contents in warn()

SEE ALSO
    tob-new --help
    tob-del --help
    Ideally, each thinobject class will provide a help method, and a
    --help option to each of its methods.

BUGS
    This is an experimental system.

    Options -q, --quiet, -v, --verbose, --debug are not actually supported
    at all.  No long options are supported except --help.

    Should document all exit values.
